```bash
# Clone this repository
$ git clone https://github.com/HiagoBDev/Game-Of-Life-Test
$ npm install
$ npm install -g jest
# This will give you the dependency you need to run the tests.
# Now, I kindly ask that when running the tests, please comment out
# the functions that manipulate the DOM in the JavaScript file.
# Unfortunately, I don't know how to set up the testing environment in a way
# that these functions don't interfere with the testing process.
# also put 'export before the function'.

# Run this to run the test
$ npm test

```
